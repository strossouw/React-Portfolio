## Technologies
A react template was used to start this project. Within that template additional JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap elements were implemented to make this portfolio pop!


## Installation
If I had some installation instructions I would list those here. 

## Usage

The sole purpose of this portfolio is to show off what I can do. :) 🐈
There are multiple tabs to view my work and about me.
